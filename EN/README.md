# TwitchPlays
This file allows the Twitch or YouTube chat to play.

To run this program you will need to install Python 3.13 and additionnally an IDE.  
You will need to install the following modules using pip (directly in the cmd or in your IDE, some IDE don't require what's in parentheses, and these need to be removed):
(python -m) pip install requests
(python -m) pip install socket  
(python -m) pip install re
(python -m) pip install random
(python -m) pip install time
(python -m) pip install json
(python -m) pip install futures
(python -m) pip install pywinauto
(python -m) pip install pyautogui

When Python is installed, just change the Twitch username (or the YouTube channel ID) and the window you want the code to act in. You can also choose to accept commands to be done multiple times with one or not.

This code is based off Wituz's Twitch Plays template, then expanded by DougDoug and DDarknut with help from Ottomated for the YouTube side, this version is Duty's one that he has improved. If you want to suggest changes, you can email me at evaisdecedera@gmail.com.
